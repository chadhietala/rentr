# Rentr

This application is no where being complete.  Just want to stash it on github for now.

Rentr is an application for independant landlords and tenants to pay and accept Rent payments.  Will use [Stripe Connect](http://stripe.com) to perform Oauth 2 and financial transactions.

Hopefully this will be a good example of a non-trival ember app too.

Rentr uses the following technologies:

* Express
* MongoDB
* EmberJS
